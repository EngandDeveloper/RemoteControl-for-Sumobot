# RemoteControl-for-Sumobot

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to make a sumo robot which can fight with other sumo robots in a designated black ring with white tape around
its borders. Sumobot has two light sensors to check the white tape to avoid going out of the ring and one sonar sensor to determine the
distance between the sumobot itself and the its opponent.

Remote controller is to increase the use of this robot outside of the tournaments as remote controlled car. To make this happen I used
several tools:

In this project I used UBMP circuit board which is designed by John Rampelt. The header file (UBMP.h) and UBMP.c files are
written by him with small customizations by me to make it compatible for my project. I used Microchip's PIC16F1459 micro-controller. Thus,
PIC16F1459.c file is written by the company. I used their IDE MPLab to develop this project.

## What I Learned From This Project
- Working with MPLab
- Working with micro-controllers
- Designing a fully automated robot
- Working with circuit boards
- How to use sonar sensor to navigate and calculate distance
- Working with IR sensors and light sensors
- Writing basic C codes to control microcontrollers and other circuit components
- Reading circuit schematics
- Changing Sony's remote control process to make a remore control for my Sumobot
